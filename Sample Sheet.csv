Interest, inflation, and purchasing power Suppose Cho is a sports fan and buys only baseball caps. Cho deposits $3,000 in a bank account that pays an annual nominal interest rate of 5%. Assume this interest rate is fixed-that is, it won't change over time. At the time of her deposit, a baseball cap is priced at $15.00. Initially, the purchasing power of Cho's $3,000 deposit is baseball caps. For each of the annual infiation rates given in the following table, first determine the new price of a baseball cap, assuming it rises at the rate of inflation. Then enter the enter the value for the real interest rate at each of the given inflation rates. corresponding purchasing power of Cho's deposit after one year in the first row of the table for each inflation rate. Finally Hint: Round your answers in the first row down to the nearest baseball cap. For example, if you find that the deposit will cover 20.7 baseball caps, you would round the purchasing power down to 20 baseball caps under the assumption that Cho will not buy seven-tenths of a baseball cap.
